This is a drag'n drop lobby solution for your game! It allow to quickly add the
capability to create game, either directly or through matchmaker, & join them.

Requirement
===========

You will need a prefab of your player, using of course a NetworkBehaviour instead of a monobehaviour


How to Use It
=============

- You will need 2 scenes : one for your lobby, one for your game.
- Just drag'n drop Prefabs/LobbyUiCanvas prefab in your lobby scene
- Setup the Lobby Scene & Play Scene of the lobby
/!\ NOTE /!\ : Those scenes need to be in the build windows!

- Setup the Game Player Prefab. This prefab is the one that will be instanciated
when you go from the lobby to the game.


Passing info from lobby to play
===============================

The script UnityStandardAssets.Network.Lobby (& PlayerEntry prefab) is used as
the "Player Lobby", and have 2 parameters : color & name of the player

You can pass those info to your game prefab using a script subclassing LobbyHook
The function OnLobbyServerSceneLoadedForPlayer will be called with both as param

(In the Pong Network Example, check PongLobbyHook for an example of how use it)
